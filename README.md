===========

 This code will print out the full set of equations of the form

 -k_{i-1/2,j}Y_{i-1,j}-k_{i+1/2,j}Y_{i+1,j}-k_{i,j-1/2}Y_{i,j-1}-k_{i,j+1/2}Y_{i,j+1}+d_{i,j}Y_{i,j}=b_{i,j}

 This works for any size domain (i.e., j does not have to be equal to i). 
 
 Note, though, that the larger i and j are, the harder it will be to keep the full equation on one page.
